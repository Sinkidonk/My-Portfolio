    <h1>About the Code Archive</h1>
    <p>
        This is where all of my less useful code will live.<br>
        I am talking about all the code that was created due to a standard homework assigment.<br>
        Like debug this script, draw a circle on the screen, remove all the red from this picture.<br>
        Just stuff like that nothing special, nothing fancy.<br>
        For web code links will be provided to view it running, however just check out my github it will all be there.
    </p>
