        <p>This page will feature all of the stuff I worked on that required actual efforts from me to work on.<br>
            My final project’s as well as personal projects, anything that wasn’t just straight out of a book where it was like oh do this and then does that, oh finds and correct these errors in the code. Type of deal.
