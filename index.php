        <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio Website</h1>
        <p> This website will serve as a platform to host all of my old web projects from Gateway Technical College.<br>
Not only will this website showcase all of my web project's but it will serve to showcase all of my non-web projects as well.<br>

All of the source code for my projects will be posted on GitHub, however, due to the nature of GitHub I will be omitting any database information, username, or password to the code that gets uploaded where needed.<br>

So, hi I am Alex Parys, I graduated from Gateway Technical College with a duel Associate degree in IT Web Developer, and IT Cybersecurity Specialist, on 8/18, and 4/20 respectively. <br>

Starting in the fall I will be working on my bachelor degree at UWW-Whitewater as an Information Technology BBA Major, with an Networking and Security Emphasis, and a minor in Cybersecurity.
