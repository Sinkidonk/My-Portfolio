        <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio Website</h1>
        <p>
Well hello there,<br><br>
You found the little place where I call home on the worldwide web.<br><br>
See that picture it hard to miss it the only picture on this page, that is me.  New Face Mask Selfie.<br><br>
If you are an employer or a job recruiter and don’t care about who I am great check out my feature page. <br><br>
There you will find all of the projects I am proud to show off because I actually had to put time and effort into creating them and not just copy stuff out of a book. <br><br>
If you are anybody else, I guess you want to know who I am <br><br>
I am Alex Parys, but you already knew that. I graduated from Gateway Technical College with a two-associate degree in IT Web Developer and IT Cybersecurity Specialist with District Honors, and Presidents Honors respectively.<br><br>
Starting in the fall I will be working on my bachelor’s degree at UWW-Whitewater as an Information Technology BBA Major, with a Networking and Security Emphasis, and a minor in Cybersecurity.<br><br>
My career interests lie heavily in the Cybersecurity space, as you might have been able to tell.<br><br>
In my free time, I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons and being lazy while watching Netflix.<br><br>
Well, I hoped I didn’t bored you with my intro and welcome to my home.
